# Follow The Beat ðŸŽ§
A tool for SoundCloud users to track and filter their followers.

## Install dependencies
`npm install`

## Run tests
`npm test`

## Usage
1. Create a .env file (you can use example.env)
2. Populate it with your SoundCloud credentials
3. `npm start`

## Warning
SoundCloud closed their public API a while back, so this was built by inspecting API requests their web app makes and copying them. This is probably against SoundCloud's TOS. Use at your own risk.

## Roadmap
- Finish `LATERS` in codebase
- Improve test coverage (cover everything in `src/data`
- Add configuration interface (so we don't need `.env`)
- Make binaries


## Finding your SoundCloud credentials
